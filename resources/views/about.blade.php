            <p>Uchijollof was founded by four brilliant entrepreneurs. Rose, Beatrice, Angel and Dominic. </p>

            <p>We are on a mission to change people’s perception of food. We believe that food isn’t just meant to sustain life,
                it is meant to be art, it should be beautiful, it’s supposed to be clean, nutritious and hygienic, it is meant to be astonishingly delicious.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are experienced Chefs, we don’t only make great meals, we are also ‘veterans’ in enjoying good food as we are proudly foodies.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also understand that good food though delicious has to arrive on time because hunger isn’t funny. That is why we have ensured that our services are prompt and professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                We promise to try and possible make you see and enjoy food the way we do.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know what you need and we will give it to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brace yourselves ladies and gentlemen.
